\section{The road ahead}\label{OpenQuestionsSection}



In this section, we discuss various topics (sometimes very sketchily, sometimes in more detail) which are currently poorly understood but which also are now coming over the horizon.  A number of these will likely be resolved by the time a second printing of this book were to come around.

These are sorted roughly by their order of appearance in the book.



things are that currently in the air

may ``date'' the book as they are resolved, but it seems important to name the kinds of questions one might pursue using the tools we have built




\subsection*{Splitting bordism spectra}

\Cref{MOSplitsIntoHF2s} is the first of several similar splittings of bordism spectra, all proven by similar\footnote{Similar, at least, at some macroscopic scale.} methods:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item First, one calculates the homology $\HFtwo_* MX$ of the bordism spectrum as a comodule over the dual Steenrod algebra.
    \item Then, one shows that the associated sheaf $(\HFtwo_* MX)\widetilde{}$ is the pushforward of a simpler sheaf for some smaller structure group $G \le \InternalAut_1(\G_a)$.  (This amounts to understanding the Steenrod subcomodule generated by the unit class.)
    \item Finally, one demonstrates some algebraic structure theorem for sheaves arising through such pushforwards.  These are referred to generally as ``Milnor--Moore-type theorems''.
    \item These results then similarly assemble to yield a splitting at the level of $2$--localized spectra through Adams spectral sequence methods.\footnote{Replacing $2$ by $p$ everywhere, one can also produce odd-primary results.}
\end{enumerate}

\citeme{Find citations}
For instance, the unit class in $\HFtwo_* M\SO$ generates the submodule \[1 \cdot \mathcal A_* \mmod (\Sq^1) \subseteq \HFtwo_* M\SO,\] and an appropriate generalization of Milnor--Moore gives a splitting \[M\SO \simeq \left( \bigvee_j \Susp^{n_j} \HFtwo \right) \vee \left( \bigvee_k \Susp^{m_k} H\Z \right).\]
\cite{ABP,GiambalvoPengelley}
Similarly, there is an inclusion \[1 \cdot \mathcal A_* \mmod (\Sq^1, \Sq^2) \subseteq \HFtwo_* M\Spin,\] and a further generalization of Milnor--Moore winds up producing a splitting \[M\Spin \simeq \left( \bigvee_j kO[n_j, \infty)\right) \vee \left( \bigvee_k \Susp^{m_k} H\F_2 \right).\]
It is also true that there is an inclusion \[1 \cdot \mathcal A_* \mmod (\Sq^1, \Sq^2, \Sq^4) \subseteq \HFtwo_* M\String,\] but at this point the Adams spectral sequence becomes too intricate to analyze effectively and no analogous splitting of $M\String$ has yet been produced.  There are also complex analogues of these results:
\begin{align*}
MU & \simeq \bigvee_j \Susp^{n_j} BP, &
M\SU & \simeq \left(\bigvee_j \Susp^{n_j} BP\right) \vee \left(\bigvee_k \Susp^{m_k} BoP \right),
\end{align*}
where $BoP$ is a certain amalgam of $BP$ and $kO$ described in work of Pengelley~\cite{Pengelley}.

These spilttings---and the absence of one in the $\String$ case---are of great interest to a homotopy theorist.  In the more obvious direction, they reveal a great deal about bordism spectra in terms of well-understood spectra, but less obviously they also promise to let information flow in the opposite direction: even if we had never encountered real $K$--theory, an intensive study of $\Spin$--bordism would have led us inexorably toward it, and we could then attempt to rig a geometric model for this uncovered spectrum~\cite[pg.\ 338]{HoveyVnEltsOfRings}.  Similarly, one might hope that a successful splitting of $M\String$ would furnish us with spectra that stand a high chance of admitting a geometric model: the original spectra under $M\String$ that were considered, like $KO^{\Tate}$ and $EO_2$, had both nonconnected and completed homotopy, and so were unlikely to have direct geometric interpretation.  To a large extent, the start of this program (though not the promised geometric model) has been realized by the existence of $\tmf$: it is known that the $\sigma$--orientation produces a split inclusion \[\mathcal A^* \mmod \mathcal A^*(2) \cong \HFtwo^* \tmf \to \HFtwo^* M\String,\] hence any splitting of $\HFtwo_* M\String$ into indecomposable components will attach the unit class to a version of $\tmf$.\footnote{See, however, the results of McTague~\cite{McTague}.}  However, these methods may continue to point the way for geometry associated to the bordism spectra $MO[k, \infty)$ for still larger values of $k$.\footnote{Some footholds for the algebraic geometry of the large $k$ case were worked out by me and my coauthors~\cite{HLP}.}

The $\alpha_{1/1}$ argument: Prop 2.3.2 of Hovey's $v_n$--elements of ring spectra




\cite{KreckStolz} --- an integral geometric homology theory that agrees with LRS Elliptic homology after inverting $2$

the algebraic $K$--theory redshift conjecture, lead-in to the next section



\subsection*{Blueshift and redshift}

An important observation of Ando, Morava, and Sadofsky~\cite{AMS} is that performing the $C_p$--Tate construction on the ring spectrum $E(n)$ results in a variant of $E(n-1)$ (more specifically, it results in $E(n-1)$ with homotopy tensored up by a quite large ring).  In fact, Hovey, Sadofsky, and Kuhn show that something similar happens quite generally: if $R$ is an $E(n)$--local ring spectrum and $G$ is a finite $p$--group, then the Tate object $R^{tG}$ is an $E(n-1)$--local ring spectrum.  For simplicity in what follows, we will take $p = 2$ and $G = C_2$.

An important related result is Lin's theorem.  Because the bottom cell of $\RP^n_0$ is unattached, there is a natural wrong-way map \[\RP^n_0 \to \S^0.\]  Taking Spanier--Whitehead duals and applying Atiyah's calculation of the dual of $\RP^n_0$, we produce a map \[\S^0 \to D \RP^{(n+1)-1}_{-(0)} = \Susp \RP^{(0)-1}_{-(n+1)} \to \Susp \RP^\infty_{-(n+1)}.\]  Taking the inverse limit gives a map \[\S^0 \to \Susp \RP^\infty_{-\infty},\] which Lin showed to be a $2$--adic equivalence (and which Carlsson proved a generalization of to all other groups, known as the Segal conjecture).  From the perspective of blueshift, the qualitative form of this is not entirely unexpected: the sphere has infinite chromatic complexity, and so blueshifting it by one stage yields another spectrum of infinite chromatic complexity.

Homotopy, however, can be commuted past the inverse limit, and this yields a filtration spectral sequence \[\pi_* \S^* \Rightarrow \pi_* (S^{-1})^\wedge_2.\]  In particular, any stable stem is represented by a (coset of) element(s) on the $E_1$--page of this spectral sequence, and this inverse reading of the spectral sequence is known as the \textit{Mahowald root invariant}.  The root invariant appears to possess deeply interesting chromatic properties---not surprisingly called ``redshift'', as they stem from reading a blueshifting construction in reverse.  For instance, the root of $p$ lies in the $\alpha$--family, and the root of an $\alpha$--family element lies in the $\beta$--family~\cite{BehrensRootInv}.

There are two perspectives on this computation:
\begin{itemize}
    \item (Mahowald:) The calculation $\RP^\infty = T(\mathcal L \downarrow \RP^\infty)$ extends by taking negative multiples of the tautological bundle to give a sequence of spectra \[P^\infty_{-n} = T(-n\mathcal L \downarrow \RP^\infty)\] which extend $\RP^\infty$ into negative dimensions.  The Tate construction can then be defined by \[R^{tC_2} := \lim_{n \to \infty} \Susp R \sm P^\infty_{-n}.\]
    \item (Greenlees--May:)\footnote{Stroilova's PhD thesis~\cite{Stroilova} gives a variation of this construction that converts an $E(n)$--local ring spectrum to an $E(n-k)$--local ring spectrum.} There is a general formula \[R^{tG} = (F(EG_+, R) \sm \widetilde{EG})^G,\] whose pieces in the case at hand consist of $EG_+ = S(\infty \L)$ and $\widetilde{EG} = S^{\infty \mathcal L}$, which rearranges to give \[R^{tC_2} := \colim_{m \to \infty} F(P^\infty_{-m}, R).\]
\end{itemize}
Already, something spooky has happened: a colimit and a limit were inexplicably interchanged.\footnote{There are also ``finitary'' flavors of chromatic localization available, which are typically less categorically robust but more computable.  They assemble into a diagram:
\[\begin{array}{ccccc}
E & \to & L_d^{\fin} E & \to & L_d E \\
\downarrow & & \downarrow & & \downarrow \\
L_{X(d)} E & \to & \widehat L_d^{\fin} E & \to & \widehat L_d E,
\end{array}\]
where $X(d)$ is a finite complex of type exactly $d$, $v$ is a $v_d$--self-map of $X(d)$, $T(d) = X(d)[v^{-1}]$ is the localizing telescope, $\widehat L_d^{\fin}$ is Bousfield localization with respect to $T(d)$ (which can be shown to be independent of choice of $X(d)$ and of $v$), and $L_d^{\fin}$ denotes localization with respect to the class of \emph{finite} $E(d)$--acyclics.  Much is known about these functors: for instance, $L_{X(d)} L_d = \widehat L_d$, there is a chromatic fracture square relating $L_d^{\fin}$ to $\widehat L_{\le d}^{\fin}$, and $L_d^{\fin} E \simeq L_d E$ if and only if $\widehat L_{\le d}^{\fin} E \simeq \widehat L_{\le d} E$.  One major question about these functors remains open, corresponding the last unsettled nilpotence and periodicity conjecture of Ravenel~\cite[Conjecture 10.5]{RavenelLocalizationWRTPeriodic}: is the map $\widehat L_d^{\fin} E \to \widehat L_d E$ an equivalence?  Multiple proofs and disproofs have been offered, but the literature remains unsettled. \textbf{Find some proofs and disproofs.}}



All this begs insertion into the framework for understanding chromatic homotopy theory described in the main thread of this text.  For instance, although it is illegal to commute ordinary homology past the inverse limit, the formal-geometric perspective on the isomorphism in Lin's theorem is that the residue map $\F_2(\!(x)\!) \to \F_2\{x^{-1}\}$ is a quasi-isomorphism of continuous Steenrod comodules---more on another application of algebraic residues in a moment.  The framework of $p$--divisible groups appearing around the edges of this book seems to show a lot of promise for serving as a general organizing principle for these ``transchromatic'' results.\footnote{For instance, contact between $p$--divisible groups and the Tate construction is visible in work of Greenlees and Strickland~\cite{GreenleesStrickland}, \cite[pg.\ 10]{StricklandFPFP}.}






\subsection*{Why formal groups?}

A question we have cheerfully left unresolved is: what is so special about $MU$ that makes it such an effecive tool?  There are many approaches to this question that lead one in many different directions.

First, one can ask this in terms of $MU$ as a ring spectrum, and in this setting we summarized the most important resuls about $MU$ in \Cref{MUInducesSpectrumHomeo}.  Given a general ring spectrum $R$ and thick prime $\otimes$--ideals $\CatOf C_\alpha$ of perfect $R$--modules, we ask two questions analogous to the result stated there:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Is it possible to find an $R$--algebra $S$ whose context functor induces a homeomorphism of Balmer spectra $\Spec(\CatOf{Modules}_R^{\perf}) \to \Spec(\CatOf{QCoh}(\context{S/R}))$?\footnote{Note that the right-hand side is a completely algebraic construction: these are simplicial sheaves of modules.}
\item Are there complementary localizers $L_\alpha\co \CatOf{Modules}_R \to \CatOf{Modules}_{R,(\alpha)}$?  Can they be presented via Bousfield's framework as homological localizations for auxiliary $S$--algebra spectra $S_\alpha$?  Do the contexts $\context{S_\alpha}$ admit compatible localizers with $\context{S}$?
\end{enumerate}
For $R = \S$, this is the role that the $R$--algebra $S = MU$ and the $S$--algebras $S_d = E(d)$ play.

There are some obvious restrictions on $S$: for instance, because the target of the $S$--homology map wants to be algebraic, we require that $\pi_* S$ (and $\pi_* S^{\sm_R (j)}$ generally) be even.  There are, in fact, two results in the literature that shed light on exactly this perspective: Priddy showed that by iteratively attaching cells to the $p$--local sphere in order to ensure that it has only even-dimensional homotopy, one arrives at $BP$~\cite{Priddy}; and more recently, Beardsley showed that $MU$ arises similarly by attaching certain $A_\infty$-algebra cells to kill the odd homotopy on the integral sphere~\cite{Beardsley}.\footnote{He also identifies certain intermediate spectra in this process as the spectra $X(n)$ that arise for Devinatz, Hopkins, and Smith in their proof of the nilpotence conjectures~\cite{DHS}.}  It would be satisfying to understand whether some construction like this holds in any sort of generality.

Second, using the adjunction \[\CatOf{RingSpectra}(MU, E) \cong \CatOf{Spectra}_{\S/}(\Susp^{-2} \Susp^\infty \CP^\infty, E),\] we might ask: what's so special about the space $\CP^\infty$?  Much of the contents of this book supports the following perspective: given a space $X$, consider the $E_\infty$ pro-spectrum $DX_+ = \{F(X_\alpha, \S)\}_\alpha$.  Because each $X_\alpha$ is a compact object, base-change along the unit map $\eta\co \S \to E$ is computed by the following formula:
\begin{align*}
\eta^* DX_+ = E \sm \{F(X_\alpha, \S)\}_\alpha = \{E \sm F(X_\alpha, \S)\}_\alpha = \{F(X_\alpha, E)\}_\alpha.
\end{align*}
Applying the functor $\Spf \circ \pi_0$ to this pro-system yields the formal scheme $X_E$ considered in \Cref{FullDefnOfXE}.  One of the themes of this book has been to think of the objects $X$ and $DX_+$ as spectral incarnations of some algebro-geometric recipe, which base-change along $\eta$ to form classical algebro-geometric constructions which have been ``bound'' to $E$.  The situation, as pointed out around \Cref{MUstarVsMUAsModuli}, is somewhat analogous to that of Lubin and Tate's explicit local class field theory, where a certain recipe associates to a local number field a governing formal group in terms of which much of the structure of the number field can be cast.  In the setting of algebraic topology, the ``recipe'' is embodied by $\CP^\infty$ itself, and it is enacted by this base-change construction.  Understanding in what sense $\CP^\infty$ is encoding anything (or any of the other spaces discussed in this text) is an important challenge for homotopy theorists to come.












\subsection*{Asymptotics in homotopy theory}

Various large-scale behaviors of the $MU$--Adams spectral sequence are poorly understood and would yield interesting information about stable homotopy theory as a whole.  For instance, the following question is pulled from Mike Hopkins~\cite[Section 10]{HopkinsOnRavenel}: let $g(n)$ denote the largest $MU$--Adams filtration degree of an element of $\pi_n \S$ (i.e., $g$ traces the vanishing curve on the $E_\infty$ page of the $MU$--Adams spectral sequence).  The nilpotence conjectures are all equivalent to the statement \[\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{g(n)}{n} = 0,\] but little is known about the asymptotics of $g$ beyond this statement.  For instance, one might ask: for what $\eps > 0$ does the asymptotic formula $g(n) = \Theta(n^{\eps})$ hold?  Various values have various consequences: sufficiently small values of $\eps$ entail the Telescope Conjecture (see below), and sufficiently large values entail its failure.  Hopkins and Smith claim a plausibility argument that $\eps = 1/2$, which is a Goldilocks value where no claim about the Telescope Conjecture can be made.

Another important observation is that $\eta$ is not nilpotent in the $E_2$--term of the $MU$--Adams spectral sequence, and so generally the nilpotence theorems do not hold in the algebraic model $\CatOf{QCoh}(\moduli{fg})$ for the stable category.  Rather, the nilpotency of $\eta$ is enforced by a differential further in the spectral sequence.  This differential is actually also algebraic, but of a different nature: it stems from the $C_2$--fixed point spectral sequence for $KU^{hC_2} \simeq KO$.  Understanding what bouquet of extra algebraic techniques account for the general nilpotency of stable homotopy elements would be very interesting.

One interesting observation about this same homotopy fixed point spectral sequence is that it has a horizontal vanishing line on the $E_4$ page.  This phenomenon is quite generic~\cite{MathewMeier}, and in particular it is also true of the descent spectral sequence for $\TMF$.  This is quite interesting: the moduli stack of elliptic curves (and most moduli stacks considered in arithmetic geometry) is Artinian, meaning that it has finite stabilizer groups, but these same finiteness is the source of the infinite cohomological dimension of the moduli of elliptic curves.  After all, every nontrivial finite group has infinite integral group cohomology.  In this sense, the derived moduli of elliptic curves enjoys the benefits of both worlds of finiteness: it still has finite stabilizer groups, but it is, in a certain sense, of \emph{finite} cohomological dimension.  Surely this is useful for something: there must be some facts that arithmetic geometers wish were true, but which are stymied by the infinite cohomological dimension of $\moduli{ell}$.

A precise understanding of vanishing curves in other Adams spectral sequences, for instance Gonz\'{a}lez's results for the $BP\<1\>$--Adams spectral sequence~\cite{Gonzalez}, also give rise to sparsity results in the $MU$--Adams spectral sequence and hence control over the overall behavior.







\subsection*{Local analysis on $\moduli{fg}$}

The enormously complicated stabilizer action $\S_d \actson E_d^*$ may be amenable to qualitative analysis, and there are a great many outstanding conjectures about its behavior.  The largest one is the chromatic splitting conjecture~\cite[Conjecture 4.2]{HoveyCSC}, which (in ascending order of difficulty) states:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $H^*(\S_d; \W(\F_{p^d})[u^\pm])$ contains an exterior algebra $\Lambda[x_1, \ldots, x_d]$, where $x_j$ has cohomological degree $1$ and transforms in the $(1 - 2j)${\th} character of $\Gm$.  One of these elements has a concrete description: $x_1$ is described by the determinant homomorphism, which sends a stabilizer element in $\S_d$ to the determinant of its matrix representation as described in \Cref{FormOfStabilizerGroupEarly}.\todo{Check this rationally or rigid-analytically.}
    \item Each class $x_{i_1} \cdots x_{i_j}$ in the exterior algebra survives to a homotopy class $x_{i_1} \cdots x_{i_j}\co S_p^{-2(\sum_k i_k)+j} \to \widehat L_d \S$.
    \item The composite \[\S_p^{-2(\sum_k i_k)+j} \xrightarrow{x_{i_1} \ldots x_{i_j}} \widehat L_d \S^0 \to \Susp F(L_{d-1} \S^0, L_d \S_p^0)\] factors through \[L_{d - \max i_k} \S_p^{-2(\sum_k i_k)+j}.\]
    \item The maps above split $F(L_{d-1} \S^0, L_d \S^0_p)$ into $2^d-1$ summands.
    \item The cofiber sequence \[F(L_{d-1} \S^0, L_d \S^0_p) \to L_{d-1} \S^0_p \to L_{d-1} \widehat L_d \S^0\] splits, so that \[L_{d-1} \widehat L_d \S^0 \simeq L_{d-1} \S^0_p \vee \Susp F(L_{d-1} \S^0, L_d \S^0_p).\]
\end{enumerate}
By brute force, this conjecture has been verified in the case $d = 1$ and in the case $d = 2$, $p \ge 5$.  Very recently, Beaudry has shown that the final claim of the conjecture is \emph{false} in the case $d = 2$ and $p = 2$, but leaves open the other leaves of the conjecture.  Essentially everything else about the conjecture is unknown.

A subtle point in the above statement of the splitting conjecture is that the classes $x_j$ lie in the cohomology of $\W(\F_{p^d})$, which is \emph{not} the Lubin--Tate ring.  Remarkably, the natural map \[H^*(\S_d; \W(\F_{p^d})) \to H^*(\S_d; LT_d)\] (where we have deliberately omitted the element $u$) has turned out to be an isomorphism in the cases where the conjecture has been verified---and we do not have a conceptual reason for why this should be so.  Specializing to the case $d = 2$, Goerss has observed that this statement is equivalent to several others, any of which could be a hint:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The natural map \[H^*(\S_2; \F_{p^2}) \to H^*(\S_2; \F_{p^2}\ps{u_1})\] is an isomorphism.
    \item The Frobenius map \[\Frob\co H^*(\S_2; \F_{p^2}\ps{u_1}) \to H^*(\S_2; \F_{p^2}\ps{u_1})\] is an isomorphism.
    \item The multiplication--by--$v_1^k$ map \[v_1^k\co H^*(\S_2; \F_{p^2}\{v_1^k\}) \to H^*(\S_2; \F_{p^2})\] is zero.
\end{itemize}
In a different direction, one could hope to check that the natural map is an isomorphism just on the relevant torsion-free parts, by finding methods by which to study the maps
\begin{align*}
H^*(\S_d; \W(\F_{p^d})) \otimes \Q \to H^*(\S_d; LT_d) \otimes \Q \to H^*(\S_d; LT_d \otimes \Q).
\end{align*}
The source of these maps can be analyzed by methods from the theory of $p$--adic analytic Lie groups, as announced by Morava~\cite[Remark 2.2.5]{MoravaCobordismComodules}.

The last part of the original conjecture is its most interesting consequence: it is a statement about the interplay between two different chromatic heights.  Torii has spent much of his career analyzing algebraic models of this phenomenon---in particular, the action of $\S_{d-1}$ on the ``punctured Lubin--Tate ring'' $\F_{p^d}(\!(u_d)\!)[u^\pm]$.  Recent activity on this front indicates that there is much to mine from this vein.

A related point of interest is the action of $\S_d$ on $\F_{p^d}\ps{u_d}[u^\pm]$.  The action of $\S_d$ on the special fiber of the Lubin--Tate ring is somewhat well-understood\citeme{Ravenel}; for instance, there is a calculation \[H^*(\S_2; \F_{p^2}) \cong \left.(\F_{p^2}[\zeta][u^{\pm(p^2-1)}])\{1, h_0, h_1, g_0, g_1, t\}\middle/\left(\begin{array}{c} h_0 g_1 = t, \\ h_1 g_0 = t \end{array}\right)\right. ,\] with all unlabeled products of the roman elements equal to zero.  There is a Bockstein spectral sequence \[H^*(\S_d; \m^j / \m^{j+1}) \Rightarrow H^*(\S_d; \F_{p^d}\ps{u_d}[u^\pm]),\] where $\m = (u_d)$ is the maximal ideal in this local graded ring, and this spectral sequence displays a number of intriguing phenomena.  For one, it has ``periodic'' differentials\citeme{paper with Hopkins and Sadofsky}: again in the case of $d = 2$, one such periodic family is specified by
\begin{align*}
d_1 v_2 & = v_1 h_1, \\
d_p v_2^p & = v_1^p v_2^{p-1} h_0, \\
d_{p^n+p^{n-1}-1} v_2^{p^n} & = 2 v_2^{p^n - p^{n-1}} v_1^{p^n + p^{n-1} - 1} h_0.
\end{align*}
Even more interestingly, there are explicit lifts of these cohomology classes given as follows: \[v_2^{(n)} = v_2^{p^n} \prod_{j=0}^{n-2} \left(1 - \left( \frac{v_1^{p+1}}{v_2} \right)^{p^{n-1} - p^j} \right) \pmod{v_1^{p^n + p^{n-1}}}.\]  This looks curiously like an analytic Weierstrass product; it would be interesting to know what function it names, and whether this has any obvious impact.





\subsection*{$p$--adic Interpolation}

In projective geometry, one studies a projective variety by calculating its global sections against different line bundles: \[X \mapsto [(\L \in \Pic(X)) \mapsto H^0(X; \L)].\]  Done correctly, this can be used to recover a graded ring $R$ with a natural map $\operatorname{Proj}(R) \to X$ which is definitionally an isomorphism in the case that $X$ is affine---that is, this construction captures the isomorphism type of $X$.

This is somewhat analogous to Whitehead's theorem in homotopy theory: the Picard group of the stable category (i.e., the group of isomorphism classes of spectra $Y$ such that there exists a $Y^{-1}$ with $Y \sm Y^{-1} \simeq \S^0$) consists of precisely the stable spheres.  However, in the $K(1)$--local category there are many more invertible objects---in fact, the Picard group of this category has the form \[\operatorname{Pic}(\CatOf{QCoh}(\CatOf{Spectra}_{\G_m})) \cong \Z_p \times \Z / (2p-2).\]  Although Whitehead's theorem only requires testing against the ``standard spheres'', now a subgroup of the \emph{much} larger Picard group, the homotopy groups of $K(1)$--local spectra display interesting interactions with the larger group.  For instance, an interesting feature of $\pi_* \widehat L_1 \S$ (as described in \Cref{piLK1SExample}) is its evident \emph{$p$--adic continuity}: the symbol $k$ in that formula can be taken to be any $p$--adic integer, and indeed this formula continues to hold when testing against other elements of the $\G_m$--local Picard group.

The hope is that these observations can be used to summarize the behavior of the homotopy of the $\Gamma_2$--local sphere, which is known by work of Shimomura and collaborators~\cite{Shimomura,ShimomuraYabeM20,ShimomuraYabeL2S,BehrensRevisited}, but which is \emph{exceedingly} complicated.  One wonders whether sufficiently strong continuity properties can be used to study this object from a more global, aggregate perspective, analogous to the relative ease of studying number theoretic $L$--functions as opposed to trying to understand them through painstaking computation of their special values.  Such a program was initiated by Hopkins~\cite{StricklandpAdicInterpolation}, from which a partial collection of results have emerged.\footnote{Behrens has also pursued a program encoding this problem in terms of modular forms~\cite{BehrensCongruences,BehrensModularDescription,BehrensBuildings}.}  Most strikingly, Mitchell \cite{MitchellIwasawa,HahnMitchell} has fully elucidated this program in the $\G_m$--local category, Hovey and Strickland have shown a restricted continuity result in the general setting~\cite[Section 14]{HoveyStrickland}\footnote{Also interesting are some negative results~\cite[Section 15.2]{HoveyStrickland}.}, and the original work of Hopkins, Mahowald, and Sadofsky~\cite{HMS} shows that the following pair of squares are both pullbacks:
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
\CatOf{Spectra}_{\Gamma_d} \arrow{r} \arrow[bend left=12]{rr} & \CatOf{QCoh}((\moduli{fg})^\wedge_{\Gamma_d}) \arrow[densely dotted]{r} & \CatOf{QCoh}(k) \\
\operatorname{Pic}(\CatOf{Spectra}_{\Gamma_d}) \arrow{r} \arrow{u} & \operatorname{Pic}(\CatOf{QCoh}((\moduli{fg})^\wedge_{\Gamma_d})) \arrow{r} \arrow{u} & \operatorname{Pic}(\CatOf{QCoh}(k)) \arrow{u},
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
allowing for the easy detection of invertible $\Gamma_d$--local spectra.\footnote{There are interesting basic open questions about the behavior of the horizontal map $\operatorname{Pic}(\CatOf{Spectra}_{\Gamma_d}) \to \operatorname{Pic}(\CatOf{QCoh}((\moduli{fg})^\wedge_{\Gamma_d}))$.  Is it injective?  Is it surjective?  It can be shown to be injective in the case of $p \gg \operatorname{ht} \Gamma$, and it is known to fail to be injective when $p$ is small---but then the precise degree to which it fails to be injective becomes of interest.  Picard elements in the kernel of this map are called \textit{exotic}, and they are responsible for rotating differentials in certain Adams spectral sequences with cyclic symmetries.}

There is further hope that the analogy to special values of $L$--functions can be strengthened to a precise connection: the orders of the $\G_m$--local homotopy groups of the sphere (or, equivalently, the orders of the stable image of $j$ elements) are controlled by Bernoulli denominators, which also appear as the negative special values of the Riemann $\zeta$--function.  This portends to be more than coincidence: the conjectured $p$--adic local Langlands correspondence promises a comparison between certain ``nice'' representations of the groups $\mathit{GL}_d(\Q_p)$, $\operatorname{Gal}(\overline{\Q_p} / \Q_p)$, and $\S_d$ in such a way that the $L$--functions naturally associated to each representation are equal across the correspondence.  At $d = 1$, the relevant spaces of representations are identically equal (and, in particular, the groups $\S_1$, $\mathrm{GL}_1(\Q_p)$, and $\operatorname{Gal}(\overline{\Q_p} / \Q_p)^{\mathrm{ab}}$ are themselves all equal), and the $L$--function associated to the $\S_1$--representation $E_{\G_m}(\S^0)$ is, indeed, the Riemann $\zeta$--function.  It is rather a lot to hope that this correspondence continues at higher heights, but with the current rate of progress on the $p$--adic Langlands correspondence (see, e.g., \cite{KnightThesis}) this promises to soon be testable, if not provable.\footnote{An interesting feature of the local Langlands correspondence is that it has \emph{two} geometric instantiations, stemming from the Lubin--Tate moduli of infinite level and from the \emph{Drinfel'd moduli} of infinite height.  Drinfel'd modules, the constituent poits of the Drinfel'd moduli, have the many desirable properties, but among their stranger properties is that they are naturally positive objects---a situation that a modern homotopy theorist essentially never enters.  Any kind of introduction of equicharacteristic algebraic geometry into homotopy theory would be a welcome invitation and possible point of homotopical contact between these two kinds of halves of the local Langlands program.  (One such place this is coming into view is in the ``ultrachromatic program'' of Barthel, Behrens, Schlank, and Stapleton.)}







Comparison of comodules $M$ for the isogenies pile with the action of $M_n(\Z_p)$ on $M \otimes_{E_n^*} D_\infty$ (this is a modern result due to Tomer, Tobi, Lukas, and Nat).  This is basically Nat's rational claim: start with a sheaf on the isogenies pile.  Tensor everything with $\Q$.  That turns this thing into a rational algebra under the Drinfel'd ring together with an equivariant action of $\GL_n \Q_p$.









\citeme{Yanovski}
The program above is not the only way that homotopy theory appears to admit $p$--adic interpolation, and what follows is a result of Yanovski.  A \textit{generalized homotopy cardinality function} is a function $\chi$, defined on spaces generated under finite colimits by $\pi$--finite spaces and valued in rational numbers, which satisfies
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Homotopy invariance: if $A \simeq B$, then $\chi(A) = \chi(B)$.
    \item Normalization: $\chi(*) = 1$.
    \item Additivity: $\chi(A \cup_C B) = \chi(A) + \chi(B) - \chi(C)$.
    \item Multiplicativity: $\chi(A \times B) = \chi(A) \cdot \chi(B)$.
\end{enumerate}
There is a natural family of examples of such functions: at any prime $p$, set \[\chi_{d,p}(X) = \dim K(d)^0(X) - \dim K(d)^1(X).\]  The special cases $\chi_{0, p}$ and $\chi_{\infty, p}$ recover the Euler characteristic.  The function \[|X| = \sum_{x_0 \in \pi_0 X} \prod_{n=1}^\infty |\pi_n (X, x_0)|^{(-1)^n} \in \Q_{\ge 0}\] was conjectured to be a homotopy cardinality function (on $p$--local spaces) by Baez and Dolan, but this expression of the function is too fussy to even serve as a proper definition, nevermind prove any real theorems.  For instance, it takes the values
\begin{align*}
|B\Z/p| & = \frac{1}{p}, &
|M_g| & = 2 - 2g,
\end{align*}
but only after regularizing the infinite sums appearing in the definition.  Using the results of \Cref{CoopnsForMoravaKandHA}, we can compute
\begin{align*}
\chi_{d,p}(B\Z/p) & = p^d, &
\chi_{d,p}(\OS{H\Z/p}{m}) & = p^{\binom{d}{m}},
\end{align*}
and this suggests formulas like \[|B\Z/p| = \chi_{1,p}(B\Z/p) + \chi_{2,p}(B\Z/p) + \cdots.\]  Taking $p \ne 2$, Yanovsky showed that the function $n \mapsto \chi_{n, p}(X)$ extends uniquely to a dyadic analytic function $\widehat L_{X,p}\co \Z^\wedge_2 \to \Z^\wedge_2$ and that the Baez--Dolan function appears as $\widehat L_{X,p}(-1)$.  This shows that it is indeed a homotopy cardinality function, and it recovers formulas like the one above: \[\widehat L_{\OS{H\Z/p}{m}, p}(-1) = p^{\binom{-1}{m}} = p^{(-1)^m} = |\OS{H\Z/p}{m}|.\]







\subsection*{Interaction with Dieudonn\'e theory}

In \Cref{SectionDieudonneModules}, we gave a pair of definitions of a Dieudonn\'e module, one contravariant and one covariant, and in \Cref{DieudonneDualityThm} we announced that the resulting modules were linearly dual to one another.  This is a remarkably difficult theorem to prove, it is hard to find an accessible proof in the literature,\footnote{In fact, Grothendieck introduced the de Rham--Dieudonn\'e functor and crystalline Dieudonn\'e theory in the same landmark paper, but elected not to provide a proof of an equivalence of his methods with past ones.} and a \emph{geometric} proof appears not to exist.

To set the stage, we summarize the proof of Mazur and Messing~\cite[Section II.15]{MazurMessing}.  First, the functor of curves is both representable and corepresentable in the category of formal group schemes by the \textit{formal (co)Witt scheme}~\cite[Chapter 3]{ZinkCartierTheory}, \cite[Section III.4]{LazardCFGs}:
\begin{align*}
\CatOf{FormalSchemes}(\A^1, \G)^{\ptyp} & \cong \CatOf{FormalGroups}(\widehat{\W}_p, \G) \\
& \cong \CatOf{FormalGroups}(\G^*, \widehat{C\mathbb W}_p).
\end{align*}
There is a canonical short exact sequence \[0 \to \G_a \to \widehat{C\W}_p \xrightarrow{V} \widehat{C\W}_p \to 0,\] and a co-curve $\gamma^*\co \G \to \widehat{C\W}_p$ gives a pullback sequence
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
0 \arrow{r} & \G_a \arrow{r} & \widehat{\W}_p \arrow["V"]{r} & \widehat{\W}_p \arrow{r} & 0 \\
0 \arrow{r} & \G_a \arrow{r} \arrow[equal]{u} & E \arrow{r} \arrow{u} & \G \arrow{r} \arrow["\gamma^*"]{u} & 0.
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
This latter sequence is a \textit{rigidified extension} of $\G$ by $\G_a$, as in \Cref{ExtensionsPresentationOfDieudonne}.  The conclusion of Mazur and Messing is that this assignment is an isomorphism.

We suspect that the two Dieudonn\'e functors can be connected via a \textit{residue pairing} between forms on $\G$ over $\W(k)$ and curves on $\G_0$ over $k$.  For inspiration, the residue pairing for an equicharacteristic local field \[\<-,-\>\co k(\!(z)\!) \times k(\!(z)\!)^* \to k\] is given by the formula \[\<g, f\> = \operatorname{Res}_{z=0}\left(g \cdot \frac{df}{f}\right) = \operatorname{Res}_{z=0}(g \cdot d\log f).\]  There are several ingredients in its construction for which we must find formal group analogues.  First, we must deal with the different ground objects $\W_p(k)$ and $k$ for $\G$ and $\G_0$:
\begin{lemma}[{\cite[Lemma VII.7.5]{LazardCFGs}}]
There is a $(\W, F)$--linear section $\sigma$ of the base-change map $D_* \G \to D_* \G_0$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}[Construction]
Cartier constructs an auxiliary Dieudonn\'e module $M$ by picking a presentation\footnote{The formal group so constructed does not actually depend upon the presentation.} \[D_* \G_0 = \left.\W_p(k)\{\gamma, V\gamma, \ldots, V^{d-1} \gamma\} \middle/ \left(F V^i \gamma = \sum_{j=0}^{d-1} c_{i,j} V^j \gamma\right) \right.\] and forming the module \[M := \left.\W_p(\W_p(k))\<\!\<V\>\!\>\{\widetilde\gamma_0, \ldots, \widetilde\gamma_{d-1}\} \middle/ \left(F \widetilde \gamma_i = \sum_{j=0}^{d-1} \Delta(c_{i,j}) \widetilde\gamma_j\right) \right. .\]  There is a $(\W, F)$--linear map $\tau\co D_* \G_0 \to M$ given by base-change along $\Delta$, and Cartier shows that this map has a universal property~\cite[VII.2.9]{LazardCFGs}: $(\W, F)$--linear objects under $D_* \G_0$ agree with Dieudonn\'e modules under $M$ by restriction along $\tau$.  Reapplying the change-of-rings functor $\pi_* M$ gives the Cartier--Dieudonn\'e module for the universal additive extension of $\G_0$~\cite[V.6.22 and VII.2.28]{LazardCFGs}, and hence $D_* \G$ is a Dieudonn\'e module under $\pi_* M$, and hence under $M$.  This gives the desired map \[\sigma\co D_* \G_0 \to D_* \G. \qedhere\]
\end{proof}

Second, we must produce an analogue of logarithmic differentiation, which is responsible for the bilinearity on the side of the differential form.  This arises naturally when trying to find analogues of differentiation internal to formal groups:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The fiber sequence \[T_0 V \to T_* V \to V\] described around \Cref{ConstructionTangentAffineScheme} does not naturally split: an arbitrary formal variety has no intrinsic notion of ``constant vector field''~\cite[V.11.12]{LazardCFGs}.  However, in the presence of a formal group structure $\widehat{\mathbb H}$ on $V$, the tangent space acquires a natural splitting analogous to the splitting in classical Lie theory:\footnote{This topic also arises when trying to understand what is special about curves in the image of Cartier's section $\sigma$: they are \emph{horizontal} in a related sense.}
    \begin{align*}
    \mathbb H \times (\G_a \otimes \Lie \widehat{\mathbb H}) & \xrightarrow{\cong} T_* \widehat{\mathbb H}, \\
    (x, \xi) & \mapsto x +_{\widehat{\mathbb H}} \eps \cdot \xi.
    \end{align*}
    This gives rise to an invariant notion of differentiation: given two formal groups $\G$, $\widehat{\mathbb H}$ as well as any pointed map $f\co \widehat{\mathbb H} \to \G$ of formal varieties, there is a function \[D_{\widehat{\mathbb H}}^{\G} f\co \widehat{\mathbb H} \to \G_a \otimes (\Lie \widehat{\mathbb H})^* \otimes \Lie \G\] characterized by \[T_* f(x +_{\widehat{\mathbb H}} \eps \cdot \xi) = f(x) +_{\widehat{\mathbb H}} \eps \cdot (D_{\G}^{\widehat{\mathbb H}} f)(x) \xi.\]
    \item By taking $\G_a$ as a model for $\A^1$, any curve $\gamma\co \A^1 \to \G$ can be interpreted as a map of formal varieties $\gamma\co \G_a \to \G$.  Applying the recipe above gives rise to a function $\A^1 \to \G_a \otimes \Lie \G$, i.e., a series with coefficients in $\Lie \G$.  This series can actually be given explicitly~\cite[V.7.3]{LazardCFGs}: \[\gamma \mapsto \sum_{n=1}^\infty t^{n-1} \Lie(F_n \gamma).\]  In particular, for $\G = \G_a$, this computes the classical derivative of $\gamma$ expanded in the canonical coordinate~\cite[V.7.13]{LazardCFGs}.
    \item This assignment is compatible with the Dieudonn\'e module structures on curves on $\G$ and curves on $\G_a \otimes \Lie \G$.  The inverse Dieudonn\'e functor then gives rise to a map \[\breve D_{\G}\co \G \to \G_a \otimes \Lie \G,\] called the \textit{reduced derivative}.  This construction is natural in $\G$, so if $\G$ had a logarithm, there would be a commuting square
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzcd}[column sep=4em]
    \G \arrow["\breve D_{\G}"]{d} \arrow["\log_{\G}"]{r} & \G_a \otimes \Lie G \arrow["\breve D_{\G_a \otimes \Lie G}"]{d} \\
    \G_a \otimes \Lie \G \arrow["\log_{\G_a \otimes \Lie \G}", equal]{r} & \G_a \otimes \Lie G.
    \end{tikzcd}
    \end{center}
    The bottom logarithm is the identity, since the source is already additive.  If we evaluate these maps on a curve $\gamma \in C_* \G$, we arrive at the equation~\cite[V.8.5]{LazardCFGs} \[\breve D_{\G} \circ \gamma = \breve D_{\G_a \otimes \Lie G} \circ \log_{\G} \circ \gamma = \frac{d}{dt} \left( (\log_\G \circ \gamma)(t) \right).\]  Hence, $\breve D_{\G}$ plays the role of a logarithmic derivative.
\end{enumerate}

The conjecture, then, is that these pieces go much of the way towards describing a local residue pairing internal to the theory of formal groups, but there are still several details left to the enterprising reader, such as: should the de Rham complex be replaced?\footnote{Relatedly, can $\breve D_{\G}$ or $D_{\widehat{\mathbb H}}^{\widehat{\mathbb G}}$ be used to give a coordinate-free description of the deformation complex of \Cref{DeformationComplex}?}  Where do \emph{primitives} in de Rham cohomology enter play?  How do the formulas for $\sigma$ in terms of $\breve D_{\G}$~\cite[VII.6.14]{LazardCFGs} enter this story---presumably in demonstrating perfection?

In a more topological direction, one wonders to what extent it is critical to use $\HFp$ in the machinery built up in \Cref{LEFTCooperations}.  In particular, could $\HFp$ be replaced by another field spectrum to build Morava $K$--theoretic analogues of Brown--Gitler spectra?  There is some existing work on this in the height $1$ case, due to Bousfield~\cite{BousfieldLambdaRings}, but the matter remains ultimately unsettled.





\subsection*{Structured ring spectra}

As indicated in the introduction to \Cref{PowerOpnsChapter}, the algebraic geometry of $E_\infty$ ring spectra is still very much in flux, and accordingly there are a lot of interesting open questions about their interaction with the story presented here.

One of the most obvious ones, almost directly cribbed out of \Cref{ConstructionOfTMFSection}, is whether $\moduli{fg}$ itself admits a topological enrichment.  This question is somewhat flexible, since varying the Grothendieck topology chosen on $\moduli{fg}$ will almost certainly affect the positivity of the answer---but, even admitting the existence of a huge family of implicit questions, essentially nothing is known.  This is meant in a very strong sense: we do not even have an example of a formal group that cannot arise as the formal group associated to a complex-orientable cohomology theory.  If we had such an example of a prohibited formal group, then if the selecting map $\Spec R^0 \to \moduli{fg}$ were furthermore (for example) flat we could conclude that there cannot exist a topological enrichment of the flat site.  We do have one very extreme example: a recent result of Lawson showed that $BP$ does \emph{not} admit an $E_\infty$ structure---at least at $p = 2$, but his techniques are expected to yield results at odd primes as well.  Since $\Spec BPP_0 \to \moduli{fg} \times \Spec \Z_{(p)}$ is an fpqc-cover, it follows that the fpqc-site of $\moduli{fg}$ cannot admit a topological enrichment.  One shouldn't take this result as too discouraging: the stack $\moduli{fg}$ is very large, and the fpqc-topology is very permissive, and so an alteration of either one may yield a positive result.  On the other hand, May asked the question of whether $BP$ admits an $E_\infty$ structure over three decades prior (and it has had a long and storied intervening history), and that delay may serve as discouragement on its own.  Some other richer stacks than $\moduli{fg}$ are known not to admit enrichment: for instance, it is known that one cannot adjoin $p${\th} roots to $E_\infty$ rings, from which it follows that there cannot exist a topological enrichment of (almost any piece of) the moduli of formal groups equipped with level--$p$ structures.\footnote{In particular, this appears to inhibit us from producing a spectrum embodying the Lubin--Tate tower at infinite level, which is a bummer from the perspective of the local Langlands program discussed above.}  Meanwhile, other stacks are: there are spectra $\TAF$, an abbreviation for ``topological automorphic forms'', which generalize $\TMF$, and Lawson has constructed spectra associated to certain stacks of formal $A$--modules.

Meanwhile, even though we know that the spectrum $E_\Gamma$ admits an $E_\infty$ ring structure and we have analyzed the set of $H_\infty$ complex orientations of $E_\Gamma$, it is not known whether there is an $E_\infty$ orientation.  This question has received plenty of attention: most recently, Hopkins and Lawson have produced a spectral sequence computing the space of such maps, the first differential of which encodes the norm coherence condition of \Cref{PowerOpnsSection}.  Their work organizes a process that is manually understandable at low heights: the natural map $\mathbb P(\Susp^{-2} \CP^\infty) \to MU$ is a rational isomorphism of $E_\infty$ rings, but at height $1$ it is not, essentially because the collection of power operations for $\G_m$--local $E_\infty$ rings acts freely on the source but not on the target.  This can be corrected for with a single rationally-acyclic term, altogether begetting a two-term free resolution of $MU$ as an $L_1$--local $E_\infty$ ring spectrum.  Again, this resolution is insufficient when localized at $\Gamma_2$, and the process continues ad infinitum as in the Hopkins--Lawson paper.  Understanding this spectral sequence even in the height $2$ case, as specialized to $E_{\Gamma_2}$, would be an extremely interesting exercise, as it would illuminate the single extra condition at height $2$ needed to enrich a norm coherent orientation to an $E_\infty$ orientation.







As we observed in the main proof of \Cref{JuvitopTalkSection}, the $E_\infty$ ring structure on a spectrum can be mined for interesting arithmetic information in rather unexpected ways: computation of the Miller invariant for $KO$ yields the Bernoulli numbers, and the same for $TMF$ yields the normalized Eisenstein series.  The original computation of the Miller invariant for $MU$ was performed by studying the $S^1$--transfer map, and it was concluded that the results are essentially the same for any complex-orientable cohomology theory: there is a set of ``universal Bernoulli numbers'' lying over $\moduli{fgl}$, and the Miller invariant for other complex-orientable theories is always computed by the pushforward of these universal values along the classifying map.  Baker, Carlisle, Gray, Hilditch, Richter, and Wood~\cite{BCGHRW} have shown that one can produce other interesting number theoretic phenomena by instead using the iterated $S^1$--transfer (or, equivalently, the transfer for a torus).  Since Morava's theories $E_\Gamma$ are known to be $E_\infty$ rings, one wonders what functions on Lubin--Tate space these iterated transfers select.

Hopkins has also highlighted the simultaneous connections between $\gl_1 \tmf$, number theory, and manifold geometry at the end of one of his Talbot talks~\cite{HopkinsTheStringOrientation}.  One place the analysis of $\gl_1 KO$ could be strengthened (and which would, presumably, also strengthen the analysis of $\gl_1 \tmf$) would be to \emph{uniquely} characterize the Bernoulli sequences appearing in \Cref{JuvitopTalkSection}.  More than one sequence satisfies those simultaneous congruences~\cite{SprangNaumann}, but the natural one appearing in the Bernoulli numbers is in some sense the ``smallest'' one.  It would be interesting to have a non-tautological encoding of this statement, in such a way that certain orientations in other contexts might also be singled out as preferable.  It would also be interesting if this could be encoded as a ``real place'' condition, which had a topological incarnation in terms of a smooth cohomology theory like differential real $K$--theory.

An unpublished theorem of Hopkins and Lurie states that the \textit{discrepancy spectrum}, defined by the fiber sequence \[F_\Gamma \to \gl_1 E_\Gamma \to L_d \gl_1 E_\Gamma,\] satisfies $F_\Gamma \simeq \Susp^d I_{\Z}$, where $I_{\Z}$ is the Anderson dualizing spectrum.\footnote{This follows from the resolution of \cite[Conjecture 5.4.14]{HopkinsLurie}, which states $\CatOf{Spectra}(H\Z/p, \gl_1 E_\Gamma) = \Susp^d H\Z/p$, together with the characterization that a coconnective spectrum $R$ (such as $F_\Gamma$) satisfies $\CatOf{Spectra}(H\Z, R) \cong H\Z$ if and only if $R$ is the Anderson dualizing spectrum.}  The Anderson dualizing spectrum fits into the fiber sequence \[I_{\Z} \to I_{\Q} \to I_{\Q/\Z},\] where the rational dualizing spectrum $I_{\Q} = H\Q$ and Brown--Comenetz dualizing spectrum $I_{\Q/\Z}$ are defined so as to satisfy the relations
\begin{align*}
\pi_0 F(E, I_{\Q}) & = \CatOf{AbelianGroups}(\pi_0 E, \Q), \\
\pi_0 F(E, I_{\Q/\Z}) & = \CatOf{AbelianGroups}(\pi_0 E, \Q/\Z).
\end{align*}
By setting $E = \S$, it follows that the homotopy groups of $I_{\Z}$ mostly match those of $\S$ itself (or, rather, their Pontryagin duals), so computing them is equivalent to computing the homotopy groups of spheres.  The Hopkins--Lurie theorem gives an interesting approach to performing this computation: the chromatic fracture square for $L_d \gl_1 E_\Gamma$ couples to the logarithm to rewrite this square in terms of $\widehat L_j$--localizations of $E_\Gamma$, intertwined by very complicated power operation formulas.  It would be an extremely interesting exercise to see this play out even at low heights.

Finally there is a substantially different approach to associating algebro-geometric objects to elliptic cohomologym, as pioneered in work of Grojnowski~\cite{Grojnowski} and of Ginzburg--Kapranov--Vasserot~\cite{GKV}, which has been used to enormous effect by Lurie in his wide-ranging program to realize various pieces of elliptic cohomology completely internally to the algebric geometry of $E_\infty$ ring spectra~\cite{LurieSurveyOfEll}.\footnote{The $\sigma$--orientation arises essentially from considering the objects associated to $BU(n)$ and $BO(n)$ using these machines (see \cite[Section 5.1]{LurieSurveyOfEll} especially) and identifying certain naturally occuring local systems (of spectra).}  Any serious student of elliptic cohomology should also become familiar with this framework.







\subsection*{Equivariance}

Since the resolution of the Kervaire invariant one question by Hill, Hopkins, and Ravenel~\cite{HHR}, the field of equivariant homotopy theory has enjoyed a serious revitalization after a rather quiet preceding period.  There is a lot to study here, and most of it is better elucidated elsewhere, but one of the central points of the Hill--Hopkins--Ravenel program is exactly the employ of formal geometry.  Namely, one of their main tools is the moduli of formal $\Z[\sqrt{i}]$--modules, which are formal groups equipped with a certain $C_8$--action affecting multiplication by the associated powers of $\sqrt{i}$ on the tangent space.  They take as a model for this a certain bouquet of copies of $MU$, which selects four coordinates on a given formal group, intertwined by this action of $\sqrt{i}$.  This approach to this problem has historical precedent: the Kervaire invariant one problem is the $p = 2$ case of a family of prime-indexed problems, and the versions satisfying $p \ge 5$ were simultaneously resolved by Ravenel by similar methods with formal $A$--modules~\cite{RavenelNonexistenceArfInvariantElts}.  This leaves one case open: the Kervaire problem at $p = 3$ remains unresolved.  From the perspective of formal $A$--modules, this is somewhat predictable: at least primes, a certain map is $p$--adically continuous but fails to be continuous at small primes.\footnote{Behrens gave a talk at the MSRI Hot Topics session on the Kervaire problem in 2010.  He addresses this point at the timecode 1h04m20s in the recorded video.}

In a different direction, the moduli of formal $A$--modules has bee used to great effect by Salch to make computations deep into the chromatic layers.  In essence, the theory of formal $A$--modules grant access to multiplicative ``height amplification'' theorems: deep knowledge of the homotopy groups of spheres at height $2$ can yield extensive information at height $2 \cdot 2$, for instance.  Salch's methods also promise to yield connections to the $L$--functions perspective described above, fitting into a larger program that describes the homotopy groups of higher-height localizations of spheres in much the way that polyzeta functions are associated to arithmetic schemes of cohomological dimension larger than $1$.



\subsection*{Index theorems}

In closing the book, we finally address the lurking physical inspiration for the $\sigma$--orientation.  One of the most remarkable developments of modern physics, from the perspective of a mathematician, is their ability to ``guess'' the Atiyah--Singer index theorem: there is a path integral formulation for the supertrace of the Dirac operator on a $\Spin$ manifold $M$ which expresses it as the time evolution of a mass $1$ supersymmetric particle evolving through $M$, and standard expansions for this physical system lead directly to the discovery of the $\widehat A$--genus and, ultimately, the index formula \[\operatorname{ind} /\!\!\!\partial_+ = \operatorname{Tr}_s e^{-H} = (2 \pi i)^{-\frac{n}{2}} \int_M \widehat A(M).\]  The $\sigma$--orientation was uncovered by Witten when studying the free loopspace $\L M$ of the manifold $M$, which is indeed a natural space to consider when studying string theory on $M$.  The condition that $M$ be $\String$ is exactly the precondition that $\L M$ be $\Spin$, so that an analogous Dirac operator exists.  The $\sigma$--orientation then arises when trying to express a formula for the index of the Dirac operator on the free loopspace in terms of invariants of $M$ and using analogous path integral methods.

Because of the predictive power of the physical appartus, one might hope to uncover other types of analytic data from it---for instance, a geometric theory of elliptic cohomology.  In addition to the variant of bordism theory described far above, the most long-standing program is due to Stolz and Teichner\citeme{Stolz and Teichner}, though it is not alone even among physically-inspired theories\citeme{Henriques}.

One of the remarkable features of loop groups is that this process does not appear to be iterable: the theory of compact Lie groups is exceedingly nice (for instance: they have surjective exponential maps), the theory of loopgroups formed from compact Lie groups is only slightly less nice (for instance: they have dense exponential maps), and any extension of this seems to immediately go to pot.\footnote{For instance, little positive is known about the group of free ``tori'', i.e., the loop group of a loop group.}  Finding the ``next step'' after loop groups is an extreme difficult problem that requires such inventive thinking that it could only ever open enormous avenues for generalization.
