The picture of M_fg can be edited with inkscape. To produce the pdf to be
included into the book, select "Save a Copy", and save as drawing.pdf. After
pressing "OK", you have to change the "Text output options" to "Omit text in
PDF and create LaTeX file". Then press okay again.

Due to a bug in Inkscape, it is likely that after doing so, the document is not
able to compile. To fix it, manually edit drawing.pdf_tex and remove the line
that says

    \put(0,0){\includegraphics[width=\unitlength,page=2]{drawing.pdf}}%
