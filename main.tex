\todo[inline]{Make sure you use either $\id$ or $1$ everywhere to denote the identity morphism.}

\todo[inline]{Double check that you're careful about choosing consistent names for your objects: $S = \Spec R$ is the base scheme, that sort of thing.}

\chapter*{Material for lecture}






Mike's 1995 announcement is a nice read. There are many snippets you could pull out of it for use here. ``$H\Q$ serves as the target for the Todd genus, but actually the Todd genus of a manifold is an integer and it turns out that $KU$ refines the Todd genus.''  The end of section 3, with $\tau \mapsto 1/\tau$, is mysterious.  In section 4, Mike claims that there's a $BU[6, \infty)$--structured splitting principle into sums of things of the form $(1 - \L_1)(1 - \L_2)(1 - \L_3)$.  He then says that one expects the characteristic series of a $BU[6, \infty)$--genus to be a series of $3$ variables, which is nice intuition.  Could mention that $\Theta^k$ is a kind of $k${\th} difference operator, so that things in the kernel of $\Theta^k$ are ``$k${\th} order polynomials''.  (More than this, the theorem of the cube is reasonable from this perspective, since $\Theta^3$ kills ``quadratic things'' and the topological object $H^2(-; \Z)$ classifying line bundles is indeed ``quadratic''.)  If the bundle admits a symmetry operation, then the fiber over $(x, y, -x-y)$ is canonically trivialized, so a $\Sigma$--structure on a symmetric line bundle is a $\Theta^3$--structure that restricts to the identity on these canonical parts.  Mike claims (Theorem 6.2) that if $1/2 \in E^0(*)$ or if $E$ is $K(n)$--local, $n \le 2$, then $B\String^E$ is the parameter space of $\Sigma$--structures on the sheaf of functions vanishing at the identity on $G_E$.  The map $M\String \to KO_{\Tate}$ actually factors through $M\Spin$, so even though this produces the right $q$--series, you really need to know that $M\String$ factors through $\tmf$ and $M\Spin$ \emph{doesn't} to deduce the modularity for $\String$--manifolds.  (You can prove modularity separately for $BU[6, \infty)$--manifolds, though, by essentially the same technique: refer to the rest of the (complex!) moduli of elliptic curves, which exist as $MU[6, \infty)$--spectra.)

Generally: if $X$ is a space, then $X_{H\F_2}$ is a scheme with an $\Aut \widehat \G_a$--action. If $X$ is a spectrum (so it fails to have a diagonal map) then $(H\F_2)_* X$ is just an $\F_2$--module, also with an $\Aut \widehat \G_a$--action.

The cohomology of a qc sheaf pushed forward from a scheme to a stack along a cover agrees with just the cohomology over the scheme. (In the case of $* \to * \mmod G$, this probably uses the cospan $* \to * \mmod G \leftarrow *$ with pullback $G$...)

Akhil Mathew has notes from an algebraic geometry class ( https://math.berkeley.edu/{\textasciitilde}amathew/232b.pdf ) where lectures 3--5 address the theorem of the cube.

Equivalences of various sorts of cohomologies: Ext in modules and quasicoherent cohomology (goodness. Hartshorne, I suppose); Ext in comodules and quasicoherent cohomology on stacks (COCTALOS Lemma 12.4); quasicoherent cohomology on simplicial schemes (Stacks project 09VK).

Make clear the distinction between $E_n$ and $\widehat{E(n)}$. Maybe explain the Devinatz--Hopkins remark that $r: \widehat{E(n)} \to E_n$ is an inclusion of fixed points and as such does not classify the versal formal group law.


when describing Quillen's model, he makes a lot of use of Gysin maps and Thom / Euler classes. at this point, maybe you can introduce what a Thom sheaf / Thom class is for a pointed formal curve?




\begin{lemma}[{\cite[Proposition 4.6]{StricklandFSFG}}]
A functor $X\co \CatOf{Algebras} \to \CatOf{Sets}$ is a formal scheme exactly when
\begin{enumerate}
\item $X$ preserves finite limits.
\item There exists a family of maps $X_i \to X$ from a set of $S$--schemes $X_i$ such that the induced map \[\coprod_i X_i(T) \to X(T)\] is jointly surjective for all test algebras $T$. \qed
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}






The Hattori--Stong theorem states that $MU_* \to K_* MU$ has image a direct summand.  Maybe this also deserves mention.  (Baker claims in \textit{Combinatorial and Arithmetic Identities Based on Formal Group Laws} that it has a direct algebraic proof given by Araki in \textit{Typical formal groups in complex cobordism and $K$-theory}.)

Akhil wrote a couple of blog posts about Ochanine's theorem: \texttt{https://amathew.wordpress.com/2012/05/30/ochanines-theorem-on-elliptic-genera/} and \texttt{https://amathew.wordpress.com/2012/05/31/the-other-direction-of-ochaines-theorem/}. Mentioning a more precise result might lend to a more beefy introduction.
