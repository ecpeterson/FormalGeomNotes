\todo[inline]{I would like as few section titles as possible to involve people's names.}
\todo[inline]{Compile an index by replacing all the \texttt{textit} commands in definition environments with some more fancy macro that tags it for inclusion.  There's information on how indices are compiled here: https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Indexing.}
\todo[inline]{Make sure you use either $\id$ or $1$ everywhere to denote the identity morphism.}
\todo[inline]{You're not very consistent about using $\G$ or $\Gamma$ to denote an arbitrary formal group. It seems like you use one or the other based on your preference of whether it has finite height or not.}
\todo[inline]{Make sure that ``Case Study'' and ``Lecture'' are OK names by the publisher's standards. If they aren't, do a careful search-and-replace for them.}
\todo[inline]{Double check that you're careful about choosing consistent names for your objects: $S = \Spec R$ is the base scheme, that sort of thing.}
\todo[inline]{Be consistent about $\sheaf O_X$ vs $\sheaf O(X)$, and similarly with $\sheaf I_D$ versus $\sheaf I(D)$.}
\todo[inline]{Be consistent about ``$\S$'' versus ``$\S^0$'' for the standard sphere spectrum.}
\todo[inline]{We should use the convention that $\phi \in \moduli{fgl}(T)$ corresponds to $x +_\phi y \in T\ps{x, y}$ throughout.}
\todo[inline]{Clark's use of MinionPro font is really nice (cf. \texttt{https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1741495/teaching/2017spring.18.917/gamma-blurb.pdf}).  Generally, we should make an effort to pick a nice font.  http://web.willbenton.com/writing/2008/better-latex has more info about converting FF fonts for use in LaTeX, including Minion.}
\todo[inline]{Be consistent about hyphens / en-dashes connecting ``$A$/$E$/$H_\infty$'' to ``ring''.}
\todo[inline]{Use $\EinftyRings$ everywhere appropriate.}
\todo[inline]{Use ${}^*$ and not ${}^\vee$ everywhere for linear dual.}
\todo[inline]{See whether /tag instead of a right column makes step-by-step-justified align* look better.}

\chapter*{Material for lecture}

Mike's 1995 announcement is a nice read.  The end of section 3, with $\tau \mapsto 1/\tau$, is mysterious.

Akhil Mathew has notes from an algebraic geometry class ( https://math.berkeley.edu/{\textasciitilde}amathew/232b.pdf ) where lectures 3--5 address the theorem of the cube.

The Hattori--Stong theorem states that $MU_* \to K_* MU$ has image a direct summand.  Maybe this also deserves mention.  (Baker claims in \textit{Combinatorial and Arithmetic Identities Based on Formal Group Laws} that it has a direct algebraic proof given by Araki in \textit{Typical formal groups in complex cobordism and $K$-theory}.)

+ Warning: noncontinuous maps of high-dimensional formal affine spaces.
+ Description of the Lubin--Tate tower and the local Langlands correspondence
+ Uniqueness of $\O_K$-module structure in characteristic zero

\subsection*{Ideas}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Matt's calculation of $E_\infty$--orientations of $K(1)$--local spectra using the short free resolution of $MU$ in the $K(1)$--local category
\item Sinkinson's calculation and $M\BP\<m\>$--orientations
\end{enumerate}

Akhil wrote a couple of blog posts about Ochanine's theorem: \texttt{https://amathew.wordpress.com/2012/05/30/ochanines-theorem-on-elliptic-genera/} and \texttt{https://amathew.wordpress.com/2012/05/31/the-other-direction-of-ochaines-theorem/}. Mentioning a more precise result might lend to a more beefy introduction.
