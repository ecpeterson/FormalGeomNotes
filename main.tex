\todo[inline]{Make sure you use either $\id$ or $1$ everywhere to denote the identity morphism.}
\todo[inline]{You're not very consistent about using $\G$ or $\Gamma$ to denote an arbitrary formal group. It seems like you use one or the other based on your preference of whether it has finite height or not.}
\todo[inline]{Double check that you're careful about choosing consistent names for your objects: $S = \Spec R$ is the base scheme, that sort of thing.}
\todo[inline]{Be consistent about $\sheaf O_X$ vs $\sheaf O(X)$, and similarly with $\sheaf I_D$ versus $\sheaf I(D)$.}
\todo[inline]{Be consistent about ``$\S$'' versus ``$\S^0$'' for the standard sphere spectrum.}
\todo[inline]{We should use the convention that $\phi \in \moduli{fgl}(T)$ corresponds to $x +_\phi y \in T\ps{x, y}$ throughout.}
\todo[inline]{Be consistent about hyphens / en-dashes connecting ``$A$/$E$/$H_\infty$'' to ``ring''.}
\todo[inline]{Use $\EinftyRings$ everywhere appropriate.}
\todo[inline]{Use ${}^*$ and not ${}^\vee$ everywhere for linear dual.}
\todo[inline]{Make sure adjoint pairs are written with the left-adjoint on the left and with its arrow on top.}
