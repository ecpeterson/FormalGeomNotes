\bookabstract{We present various results in algebraic topology, primarily stemming from operations in bordism homology, in a unifying framework coming from algebraic geometry, primarily stemming from formal schemes.  This includes introductory presentations of chromatic homotopy theory and of elliptic cohomology.}

\todo[inline]{Make sure you use either $\id$ or $1$ everywhere to denote the identity morphism.}
\todo[inline]{You're not very consistent about using $\G$ or $\Gamma$ to denote an arbitrary formal group. It seems like you use one or the other based on your preference of whether it has finite height or not.}
\todo[inline]{Double check that you're careful about choosing consistent names for your objects: $S = \Spec R$ is the base scheme, that sort of thing.}
\todo[inline]{Be consistent about $\sheaf O_X$ vs $\sheaf O(X)$, and similarly with $\sheaf I_D$ versus $\sheaf I(D)$.}
\todo[inline]{Be consistent about ``$\S$'' versus ``$\S^0$'' for the standard sphere spectrum.}
\todo[inline]{We should use the convention that $\phi \in \moduli{fgl}(T)$ corresponds to $x +_\phi y \in T\ps{x, y}$ throughout.}
\todo[inline]{Be consistent about hyphens / en-dashes connecting ``$A$/$E$/$H_\infty$'' to ``ring''.}
\todo[inline]{Add index entries for: Bocksteins ($\tau_j$, $Q_j$, \ldots), Adams operations in A.2, formal group cohomology in 4.2 5.4 and 5.6, formal group!homomorphism in 4.1-2, Morava $K$--theory in 5.6.}
\todo[inline]{Get rid of the Appendix heading over the Bibliography.}
\todo[inline]{It's deliberate that the footnotes are not fully justified?}
\todo[inline]{Period after Theorem with citation, but not after Theorem without?}
\todo[inline]{Use title case in chapter titles, possible also in section titles.}
\todo[inline]{Use mathrm for differential d, exponential e, imaginary i.}
